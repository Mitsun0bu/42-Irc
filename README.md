# 42-Irc

The ft_IRC project is a 42 School project consisting in developping a simple IRC server implemented in C++98. It supports multiple clients and basic IRC commands, such as authentication, setting nicknames and usernames, joining channels, sending and receiving private messages, and handling operators. The server does not support server-to-server communication or a dedicated client.
